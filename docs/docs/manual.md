## Larger Ender Chests {#larger-ender-chests}

EnhancedEchest replaces the vanilla 27-slot ender chest with a configurable inventory of up to **54 slots**.

<img class="feature-shot" alt="An enhanced ender chest with 54 slots" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1f8a60e-5f31-4a30-b91b-07c5ba9243bf" />

<CardGrid>

<FeatureCard icon="MousePointer2" title="Same Block, More Space">

Players open their ender chest the same way they always have, by right-clicking an ender chest block, and get the larger inventory instead of the vanilla screen.

- Opens on right-click or via <code>/ec</code>
- The ender chest block keeps its open/close lid animation
- Size is configurable in multiples of 9, from 9 up to 54

</FeatureCard>

<FeatureCard icon="Sliders" title="Configurable Size">

The default size for a player's first chest is set with <code>enderchest.default-size</code> in <code>config.yml</code>. Admins can also resize any individual chest with <code>/ee resize</code>, and you can override the base size <strong>per rank</strong> with the <code>enhancedechest.default_size.&lt;size&gt;</code> permission.

- Valid sizes: <code>9</code>, <code>18</code>, <code>27</code>, <code>36</code>, <code>45</code>, <code>54</code>
- Invalid values are rounded to the nearest valid size
- Defaults to <code>54</code> (a full double chest)
- Per-player override by permission, see the <a href="/docs/permission-chests#default-size-permission">Permission Chests</a> page

## Multi-Chest System {#multi-chest-system}

Players are no longer limited to one ender chest. Each player can own several, managed through an in-game menu.

  <figcaption>With two or more chests, opening your ender chest brings up this menu of every chest you own, each with its slot count.</figcaption>
</figure>

<CardGrid>

<FeatureCard icon="List" title="Chest List Menu">
Run <code>/eclist</code> to open a menu listing every chest the player owns, each showing its slot count. An <strong>Edit mode</strong> checkbox switches what clicking a chest does: off by default, a chest opens straight away; tick it and clicking a chest opens its management screen where players can rename it, give it a custom icon, or set it as their main. The checkbox toggles in place without reopening the menu.
</FeatureCard>

<FeatureCard icon="Star" title="Main Chest">
With several chests, a player can pick one as their <strong>main</strong>, the one opened directly by <code>/ec</code> and by right-clicking an ender chest block. Until a main is chosen, those open the management menu instead. A new chest is never made main automatically; players set it from the menu (and can always reach the menu with <code>/eclist</code>).

One exception: while a player has a <strong>temporary chest</strong> holding spilled items (for example after a resize or a revoked rank chest), opening the ender chest always shows the menu, even with a main set. This makes sure the spilled items are seen. Once the player empties the temporary chest, it disappears and the main chest opens directly again.
</FeatureCard>

<FeatureCard icon="Palette" title="Customize Each Chest">
Personalize a chest from the in-game menu, no commands needed:

- <strong>Rename</strong>: give it a display name, with optional colours
- <strong>Choose an icon</strong>: pick any item to show in the list
- <strong>Sort</strong>: merge stacks and reorder by type in one click

Each is a server-wide toggle under <code>enderchest.features</code>. See [Configuration](/docs/configuration).

</FeatureCard>

<FeatureCard icon="Wrench" title="Admin Management">
Admins can add, resize, and delete chests for any player with <code>/ee add</code>, <code>/ee resize</code>, and <code>/ee delete</code>. Deleting a player's main chest leaves them with no main until they pick a new one from the menu.
</FeatureCard>

<FeatureCard icon="Key" title="Permission-Granted Chests">
Hand out chests by rank instead of by command. The permission <code>enhancedechest.additional_amount.&lt;count&gt;.slot.&lt;size&gt;</code> grants that many chests at that size. Multiple nodes stack, grants sync on open, and removing a node removes those chests (spilling any items to a recoverable temporary chest). The player's base chest is always kept. See the <a href="/docs/permission-chests#permission-granted-chests">Permission Chests</a> page.
</FeatureCard>

<FeatureCard icon="Eye" title="View Other Players' Chests">
With <code>/ee view &lt;player&gt;</code> an admin opens a player's chest, online or offline, in the same management menu the owner sees. One chest opens its menu directly; with several, a picker lets you choose. Grant <code>admin.view</code> for a read-only look, add <code>admin.edit</code> to take/add items and to rename, re-icon, or sort the chest, and add <code>admin.clear</code> for a <strong>Clear chest</strong> button (with a confirmation) that empties it.

## Migration {#migration}

Already have players with ender chest data? EnhancedEchest can import it from vanilla ender chests, AxVaults, PlayerVaultsX, or CustomEnderChest.

- When <code>migration.enabled</code> is <code>true</code>, an un-migrated player's vanilla ender chest is imported automatically on join
- Admins can trigger vanilla migration manually with <code>/ee migrate vanilla</code>
- Import from AxVaults with <code>/ee migrate axvaults</code>, including offline players (tested with AxVaults 2.15.0)
- Import from PlayerVaultsX with <code>/ee migrate playervaultsx</code>, including offline players (tested with PlayerVaultsX 4.4.13)
- Import from CustomEnderChest with <code>/ee migrate customenderchest</code>, including offline players (tested with CustomEnderChest 2.1.2; YAML storage required)

See the [Migration](/docs/migration) page for details.

## Bedrock Support {#bedrock-support}

Bedrock players who join through a [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/) proxy get the chest menu rendered as a proper Bedrock form, with no extra configuration needed on the EnhancedEchest side.

- The chest list, rename prompt, and "Set as main" actions all surface as Bedrock UI
- The chest inventory itself is a normal container and works on Bedrock as usual

::: tip
Keep your Geyser build reasonably up to date for the smoothest dialog conversion.

## Localization {#localization}

All player-facing text lives in editable language files. Ship a translation by copying the <code>en_US</code> folder, translating it, and pointing <code>language</code> at your new locale. See the [Language](/docs/language) page.
